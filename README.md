# Getting Started
## Step 1:
  Download and install node.js LTS for your operating system: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
  
  Once installed, open a terminal / console session and run the following command:
    ```
      $ node –-version
    ```
    
  Which should return this version number: v16.17.1
    
  Now run the following command:
    ```
      $ node –-version
    ```
    
  Which should return this version number: 8.19.2

## Step 2:
  Download and install Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

## Step 3:
  Navigate to the development environment 'backend' and run this command:
    ```
      $ npm install
    ```
    
## Step 4:
  Start the development database inside 'backend':
    ```
      $ docker-compose up -d
    ```
  then
    ```
      $ docker-compose up
    ```
    
   To stop the development database:
    ```
      $ docker-compose down
    ```
    
   To execute tests run the following command:
    ```
      $ npm test
    ```
    
   To run the linter against your code, run the following command:
    ```
     $ npm run lint
    ```
    
    
## Step 5:
   Create a separate terminal while the development database is still running. Navigate to the project directory and run this command:
    ```
      $ npm install
    ```
   Then:
    ```
      $ npm start
    ```
    
    
## Test API Endpoints using Swagger by navigating to backend and running this command:
